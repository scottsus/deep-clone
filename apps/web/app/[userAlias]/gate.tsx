            <p>
              The agent you are about to converse with has the voice of{" "}
              {clone.firstName}, which has been fine tuned with audio samples
              provided by {clone.firstName}, with consent.

              Moreover, this clone was fed with information by {clone.firstName}{" "}
              and was programmed to talk about specific areas of interest,
              mainly including üíº professional experiences, ü™Ç personal hobbies,
              and information on üçª specific friends.

            <p>
              Obviously, nothing that the clone says is legally binding, and if
              there are any errors, please take it with a grain of salt.
